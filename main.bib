abstract = {Multilayer neural networks trained with the back-propagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient-based learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of two dimensional (2-D) shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation, recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN's), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank check is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal checks. It is deployed commercially and reads several million checks per day. {\textcopyright} 1998 IEEE.},

The effectiveness of the procedure is shown by developing the pseudoresidue implementations of a modular multiplier for odd moduli RNS and of a FIR (finite impulse response) filter.

RNS implementations have a highly modular structure, and are not dependent upon large binary arithmetic elements. RNS implementations become more attractive when combined with the advantages offered by VLSI fabrication technology. In this paper, a novel design methodology has been developed for RNS structures, based on using look-up tables, which takes into consideration the unique features and requirements of RNS. The paper discusses the following three phases: 1) developing a look-up table layout model, which is used to derive relationships between the size of each modulus and both chip area and time; this model supports all types of moduli; 2) selecting the most efficient layout according to the design requirements; the procedure allows the designer to control the area, time, or the configuration of the memory module required for implementing a modulo look-up table; 3) proposing a set of multi-look-up table modules; to be used as building block units for implementing digital signal-processing architectures.

In this paper a modified residue arithmetic, called pseudo-RNS is introduced in order to alleviate some of the RNS problems when Digital Signal Processing (DSP) structures are implemented. Pseudo-RNS requires only the use of modified binary processors and exhibits a speed performance comparable with other RNS traditional approaches. Some applications of the pseudo-RNS to common DSP architectures, such as multipliers and filters, are also presented in this paper. They are compared in terms of the Area-Time Square product versus other RNS and weighted binary structures. It is proven that existing combinatorial or look-up table approaches for RNS are tailored to small designs or special applications, while the pseudo-RNS approach remains competitive also for complex systems. {\textcopyright} 1995 IEEE},

Julia is designed to be easy and fast and questions notions generally held to be "laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: 1. High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. 2. One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. 3. There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts. We introduce the Julia programming language and its design-a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming.

In the DNN architecture, which is fully RNS-based, only weights and the primary inputs in the main memory are in the binary number system (BNS). The architecture, which is called Res-DNN, offers a high energy saving while requiring higher bit count for data to handle the overflow compared to that of a BNS one. Scaling techniques in the processing elements are employed in the RNS-based computations to make the computation bit widths the same as the BNS bit width. In this architecture, the MAX pooling and ReLU activation function are implemented in the RNS format. To lower the memory usage and required memory bandwidth, we suggest a Huffman-based coding. Additionally, for accessing the weights stored in the main memory, to obtain further energy reduction, we propose a structural modification to the memory hierarchy where a lower level register file is added to the data path of these accesses. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is evaluated under seven state-of-the-art DNNs with the datasets of ImageNet and CIFAR-10. The obtained results show that Res-DNN leads to 2.5 × lower energy for computations and an average of 30% overall energy reduction compared to those of the binary counterpart.},

abstract = {A new data type called a posit is designed as a direct drop-in replacement for IEEE Standard 754 floating-point numbers (floats). Unlike earlier forms of universal number (unum) arithmetic, posits do not require interval arithmetic or variable size operands; like floats, they round if an answer is inexact. However, they provide compelling advantages over floats, including larger dynamic range, higher accuracy, better closure, bitwise identical results across systems, simpler hardware, and simpler exception handling. Posits never overflow to infinity or underflow to zero, and "Nota- Number" (NaN) indicates an action instead of a bit pattern. A posit processing unit takes less circuitry than an IEEE float FPU. With lower power use and smaller silicon footprint, the posit operations per second (POPS) supported by a chip can be significantly higher than the FLOPS using similar hardware resources. GPU accelerators and Deep Learning processors, in particular, can do more per watt and per dollar with posits, yet deliver superior answer quality. A comprehensive series of benchmarks compares floats and posits for decimals of accuracy produced for a set precision. Low precision posits provide a better solution than "approximate computing" methods that try to tolerate decreased answer quality. High precision posits provide more correct decimals than floats of the same size; in some cases, a 32-bit posit may safely replace a 64-bit float. In other words, posits beat floats at their own game.},

abstract = {Public-Key Cryptosystems are prone to wide range of cryptanalyses due to its property of having key pairs one of them is public. Therefore, the recommended length of these keys is extremely large (e.g. in RSA and D-H the key is at least 2048 bits long) and this leads the computation of such cryptosystems to be slower than the secret-key cryptosystems (i.e. AES and AES-family). Since, the key operation in such systems is the modular multiplication; in this research a novel design for the modular multiplication based on the Montgomery Multiplication, the Residue Number Systems for moduli of any form, and the Signed-Digit Representation is proposed. The proposed design outperforms the current designs in the literature in terms of delay with at least 28% faster for the key of 2048 bits long. Up to our knowledge, this design is the first design that utilizes Signed-Digit Representation with the Residue Number System for moduli of any form.},

Existing modulo multiplier architectures are improved for higher speed and regularity. These allow the use of common multiplier speed-up techniques like Wallace-tree addition and Booth recoding, resulting in the fastest known modulo multipliers.

As a move in this direction, a design is developed for a multiplier which generates the product of two numbers using purely combinational logic, i.e., in one gating step. Using straightforward diode-transistor logic, it appears presently possible to obtain products in under 1, $\mu$sec, and quotients in 3 $\mu$sec. A rapid square-root process is also outlined. Approximate component counts are given for the proposed design, and it is found that the cost of the unit would be about 10 per cent of the cost of a modern large-scale computer.},

abstract = {The residue number system (RNS) is a method for representing an integer as an n-tuple of its residues with respect to a given base. Since RNS has inherent parallelism, it is actively researched to implement a faster processing system for public-key cryptography. This paper proposes new RNS Montgomery reduction algorithms, Q-RNSs, the main part of which is twice a matrix multiplication. Letting n be the size of a base set, the number of unit modular multiplications in the proposed algorithms is evaluated as $$(2n^2+n)$$(2n2+n). This is achieved by posing a new restriction on the RNS base, namely, that its elements should have a certain quadratic residuosity. This makes it possible to remove some multiplication steps from conventional algorithms, and thus the new algorithms are simpler and have higher regularity compared with conventional ones. From our experiments, it is confirmed that there are sufficient candidates for RNS bases meeting the quadratic residuosity requirements.},

Recursive doubling involves the splitting of the computation of a function into two equally complex subfunctions whose evaluation can be performed simultaneously in two separate processors. Successive splitting of each of these subfunctions spreads the computation over more processors. This algorithm can be applied to any recurrence equation of the form xi = f(bi, g(ai, xi-1)) where f and g are functions that satisfy certain distributive and associative-like properties. Although this recurrence is first order, all linear mth-order recurrence equations can be cast into this form. Suitable applications include linear recurrence equations, polynomial evaluation, several nonlinear problems, the determination of the maximum or minimum of N numbers, and the solution of tridiagonal linear equations. The resulting algorithm computes the entire series x1, ..., xN in time proportional to [log2 N] on a computer with N-fold parallelism. On a serial computer, computation time is proportional to N.},

The addition time for signed-digit numbers of any length is equal to the addition time for two digits. The paper discusses the properties of signed-digit representations and arithmetic operations with signed-digit numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and roundoff. A brief discussion of logical design problems for a signed-digit adder concludes the presentation.},

VLSI layout implementations and comparative analysis showed that the hardware requirements and the time delay of the new proposed structure are significantly, less than other reported ones.

abstract = {We present a new RNS modular multiplication for very large operands. The algorithm is based on Montgomery's (1985) method adapted to residue arithmetic. By choosing the moduli of the RNS system reasonably large, an effect corresponding to a redundant high-radix implementation is achieved, due to the carry-free nature of residue arithmetic. The actual computation in the multiplication takes place in constant time, where the unit of time is a few simple residue operations. However, it is necessary twice to convert values from one residue system into another, operations which take O(n) time on O(n) processors, where n is the number of moduli in the RNS systems. Thus these conversions are the bottlenecks of the method, and any future improvements in RNS base conversions, or the use of particular residue systems, can immediately be applied},

abstract = {It is well-known that constant-time addition, in which the execution delay is independent of operand lengths, is feasible only if the output is expressed in a redundant representation. There are many ways of introducing redundancy and the specifics of the redundant format employed can have a major impact on the performance of constant-time addition and digit set conversion. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of constant-time addition and simultaneous format conversion. We consider full as well as partially redundant representations, where not all digit positions are redundant. The number of redundant digits and their positions can be arbitrary, yielding many possible redundant representations. Format conversion refers to changing the number and/or position of redundant digits in a representation. It is shown that such a format conversion is feasible during (ie, simultaneous with) constant time addition, even if all three operands (the two inputs and single output) are represented in distinct redundant formats. We exploit "equal-weight grouping" (EWG), wherein bits having the same weight are grouped together to achieve the constant-time addition and possible simultaneous format conversion. The analysis and data show that EWG leads to efficient implementations. We compare VLSI implementations of various constant-time addition cells and demonstrate that the conventional 4:2 compressor is the most efficient way to execute constant time-addition. We show interesting connections to prior results and indicate possible directions for further extensions.},

abstract = {Most common uses of negatively weighted bits (negabits), normally assuming arithmetic value -1(0) for logical 1(0) state, are as the most significant bit of 2-s-complement numbers and negative component in binary signed-digit (BSD) representation. More recently, weighted bit-set (WBS) encoding of generalised digit sets and practice of inverted encoding of negabits (IEN) have allowed for easy handling of any equally weighted mix of negabits and ordinary bits (posibits) via standard arithmetic cells (e.g., half/full adders, compressors, and counters), which are highly optimised for a host of simple and composite figures of merit involving delay, power, and area, and are continually improving due to their wide applicability. In this paper, we aim to promote WBS and IEN as new design concepts for designers of computer arithmetic circuits. We provide a few relevant examples from previously designed logical circuits and redesigns of established circuits such as 2-s-complement multipliers and modified booth recoders. Furthermore, we present a modulo-(2n+1) multiplier, where partial products are represented in WBS with IEN. We show that by using standard reduction cells, partial products can be reduced to two. The result is then converted, in constant time, to BSD representation and, via simple addition, to final sum.},

abstract = {This paper aims to fill the gap between theoretical studies of redundant number representation dealing-with digit-level algorithms, without considering circuit-level details or impact of digit-set encodings, and implementation-oriented studies that typically focus on one particular digit-set encoding. We recognize that radices of practical interest are powers of two, giving each high-radix digit a weight that is a power of two. Furthermore, digit sets are typically encoded in such a way that each bit of the encoded form has a power-of-2 weight within the corresponding position. These observations lead us to define the class of weighted bit-set (WBS) encodings for redundant number systems and study the general properties of this class of representations. While by no means completely general, the class of WBS encodings includes virtually every implementation of redundant arithmetic that we have encountered, including those based on hybrid redundancy. We derive general conditions for a WBS encoding to be viable or efficient and describe how arithmetic operations can be performed on redundant numbers of this type using standard arithmetic components such as full/half-adders and multiplexers.},

In this paper we have presented an efficient modified redundant binary (MRB) adder by revising computational rules for the first step of carry propagation free addition. In the proposed MRB computational rule, the intermediate sum and intermediate carry are obtained in terms of conventional (Posibits) and inverted encoding of Negabits (IEN) representation replacing the redundant digits. The proposed MRB adder is synthesized and simulated using Xilinx-ISE 14.4 software and implemented on vertex-4 FPGA device. The propagation delay and device utilization are obtained from synthesis report and are compared with conventional redundant binary adder. The synthesis report for this proposed adder shows it has significant improvement in terms of combinational delay and area. Therefore it may be useful for designing high performances VLSI architectures.},

In this paper, we show that a more general view of posibits and negabits, along with their mixed use in any combination (using inverse encoding for negabits), unifies a number of diverse implementation schemes, while at the same time making the resultant designs more efficient by avoiding custom or modified hardware elements and restricting the implementation to the use of standard arithmetic cells. Such standard cells have been highly optimized and are continually improving due to their wide applicability. Other practical benefits of our formulation include facilitation of low-voltage and low-power design, again due to the widespread availability of standard cells in variants optimized for low-voltage operation or energy economy.

abstract = {Modular multiplication is a very important arithmetic operation in residue-based real-time computing systems. In realizing these multipliers, ROM-based structures are more efficient for small moduli. Due to the exponential growth of ROM sizes, implementations with arithmetic components are more suitable for medium and large moduli. This paper presents a new modular multiplier that can deal efficiently with medium and large size moduli. The design of this modular multiplier that multiplies two n bit residue digits consists, basically, of a (n×n) binary multiplier, a ((n-1-k)×k) binary multiplier (k<n), three n-bit adders, and a small-size combinational circuit. When compared with the most competitive published work, the new multiplier reduces, significantly, both time delay and hardware requirements. The design is very suitable for VLSI realization},

The proposed approach relies on the usage of the Residue Number System (RNS) to extract parallelism on high precision integer arithmetic. Results suggest a maximum throughput of 9827 EC multiplications per second and minimum latency of 29.2 ms for a 224-bit underlying field, in a commercial Nvidia 285 GTX GPU. Performances up to an order of magnitude better in latency and 122 % in throughput are achieved regarding other approaches reported in the related art. An experimental analysis of the scalability, based on OpenCL descriptions of the proposed algorithms, suggest that further advantage can be obtained from the proposed RNS approach for GPUs and EC curves supported by underlying finite fields of smaller size, regarding implementations on general purpose multi-cores.},

First, a new formulation of the Chinese remainder theorem is proposed that reduces the size of the modulo operation. Then, the proposed formulation is applied to derive, in a simple and unified manner, R/B conversion algorithms for three of the sets. Further, using this formulation, a new algorithm along with two corresponding R/B converters for the fourth set is proposed; one of these converters is area efficient while the other is speed efficient. Next, the best R/B converter(s) for each of the sets is chosen based on the hardware complexity and/or speed. These converters are implemented for 8, 16, 32, and 64-bit dynamic ranges, using CMOS VLSI technology. Based on a post-layout performance evaluation for the VLSI implementations of the chosen converters, it is shown that in order to represent 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-bit binary numbers, the moduli set {2n,2n+1,2n-1} provides the fastest R/B converter and requires the smallest area.},

In last years, very efficient implementations of modular arithmetic have been done in RNS (RSA, ECC, pairings) as well on FPGA as on GPU. Thus the protection of RNS Montgomery modular multiplication is a crucial issue. For that purpose, some techniques have been proposed to protect this RNS operation against side channel analysis. Nevertheless, there are still no effective and generic approaches for the detection of fault injection, which would be additionnally compatible with a leak resistant arithmetic. This paper proposes a new RNS Montgomery multiplication algorithm with fault detection capability. A mathematical analysis demonstrates the validity of the proposed approach. Moreover, an architecture that implements the proposed algorithm is presented.

abstract = {This paper focuses on the security architecture for Montgomery modular multiplication over prime fields (MMMopfs). We propose a class of noninterleaved systolic secure architectures for MMMopf. Each of the proposed secure architectures has two modules, in which one is a main function module (MFM) which computes MMMopf, the other is an error detection module (EDM) which detects faults either owing to natural causes or deliberate fault injection by an attacker. In our secure architectures, several computing types of systolic array structures are adopted to implement the MFMs, and two error-detecting styles based on linear arithmetic codes are employed to construct the EDMs. We explore various combinations of computing types and error-detecting styles to get some excellent secure architectures. The best implementation of our secure architecture of Style-I can detect 99.9985% of faults in processing elements (PEs), with an average delay of 8.56% of whole Montgomery modular multiplication (MMM) computing time, and about 26.73% overhead resources. Meanwhile, the throughput rate of its MFM is 34.44% higher than that of the best pure MMMopf implementation in literature, with almost the same hardware consumption. The error detection capability, overhead proportion, and the average error-reporting delay of our secure architectures are comparable with or better than Hariri and Reyhani-Masoleh's work on secure MMM over binary extension fields. Moreover, our secure architecture of Style-II can localize 90.63% of injected PEs faults, on condition that the number of affected PEs does not exceed 3. The property of our secure architectures that the injected faults could be localized and detected is novel and valuable.},

It uses a combination of series resistor insertion and controlled closing technology. Considering the effects of residual flux to inrush transient, the grounding resistor connected to the transformer neutral point is used to restrain the inrush transient of the first closeing phase and then a 'delayed closing-strategy' is employed to reduce the inrush current magnitude of the last two phases. The simulation by EMTP indicates that the strategy would restrain the inrush transient efficiently when the residual flux can't be measured.

The methodology is based on modeling a single-phase 50 MVA transformer subjected to inrush currents through finite element method (FEM). In this perspective, the conditions of inrush currents are used to estimate the magnetic field density dispersion in the transformer and to find the values of forces in axial and radial directions. These components are distributed along the energized windings for observing the loads in high-voltage windings. Thus, this article will present investigations of electromagnetic forces, structural deformation, stresses, and safety factor on the winding of transformers when subjected to inrush current.},

abstract = {Recent advances in convolutional neural networks have considered model complexity and hardware efficiency to enable deployment onto embedded systems and mobile devices. For example, it is now well-known that the arithmetic operations of deep networks can be encoded down to 8-bit fixed-point without significant deterioration in performance. However, further reduction in precision down to as low as 3-bit fixed-point results in significant losses in performance. In this paper we propose a new data representation that enables state-of-the-art networks to be encoded to 3 bits with negligible loss in classification performance. To perform this, we take advantage of the fact that the weights and activations in a trained network naturally have non-uniform distributions. Using non-uniform, base-2 logarithmic representation to encode weights, communicate activations, and perform dot-products enables networks to 1) achieve higher classification accuracies than fixed-point at the same resolution and 2) eliminate bulky digital multipliers. Finally, we propose an end-to-end training procedure that uses log representation at 5-bits, which achieves higher final test accuracy than linear at 5-bits.},

abstract = {Modular arithmetic is a building block for a variety of applications potentially supported on embedded systems. An approach to turn modular arithmetic more efficient is to identify algorithmic modifications that would enhance the parallelization of the target arithmetic in order to exploit the properties of parallel devices and platforms. The Residue Number System (RNS) introduces data-level parallelism, enabling the parallelization even for algorithms based on modular arithmetic with several data dependencies. However, the mapping of generic algorithms to full RNS-based implementations can be complex and the utilization of suitable hardware architectures that are scalable and adaptable to different demands is required. This paper proposes and discusses an architecture with scalability features for the parallel implementation of algorithms relying on modular arithmetic fully supported by the Residue Number System (RNS). The systematic mapping of a generic modular arithmetic algorithm to the architecture is presented. It can be applied as a high level synthesis step for an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) design flow targeting modular arithmetic algorithms. An implementation with the Xilinx Virtex 4 and Altera Stratix II Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technologies of the modular exponentiation and Elliptic Curve (EC) point multiplication, used in the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and (EC) cryptographic algorithms, suggests latency results in the same order of magnitude of the fastest hardware implementations of these operations known to date.},

Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we are exploring ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21:2% top-1 and 5:6% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters.

abstract = {For implementation of a fast arithmetic algorithm and efficient hardware realization, signed digit representation is crucial. Redundant binary (RB) and 2's complement number representation is the most widely used technique for representation signed digit number. The drawbacks of RB technique include multi valued logic as well as need of unconventional hardware blocks. Though 2's complement notation is efficient and commonly applicable, it needs further optimization in terms of delay and area. In this paper we proposed binary arithmetic operation using inverted encoding of negabits (IEN), where arithmetic value -1 (0) is represented for 0 (1). The proposed IEN adder is simulated using ISim simulator and synthesized using xc4vlx15-12sf363 FPGA device. The proposed work is verified in terms of utilizing the same hardware blocks as that of conventional signed digit representations. The use of IEN representation advances the signed value in comparison with 2's complement number representation.},

The highly parallel architecture is implemented using VHDL and verified by extensive simulations in ModelSim SE. The pipelined and non-pipelined versions of the design are implemented on ASIC and FPGA platforms to allow a broad comparison. The proposed architecture requires only one iteration to complete modular multiplication and achieves 12--90 {\%} less delay as compared to the existing RNS and binary modular multipliers. The complexity of the proposed design is also less than the existing state-of-the-art RNS-based modular multipliers.

As a result, MARS offers better security than triple DES while running significantly faster than single DES. The current C implementation runs at rates of about 65 Mbit/sec. on a 200 MHz Pentium-Pro, and 85 Mbit/sec. on a 200 MHz PowerPC. In hardware, MARS can achieve a 10 speedup factor. Still, both hardware and software implementations of MARS are remarkably compact, and easily fit on a smartcard and in other limited-resource environments. The combination of high security, high speed, and flexibility, makes MARS an excellent choice for the encryption needs of the information world well into the next century.},

It is easy to construct a fast modular exponentiation by applying the algorithm repeatedly. To realize an efficient RNS Montgomery multiplication, the main contribution of this paper is to provide a new RNS base extension algorithm. Cox-Rower Architecture described in this paper is a hardware suitable for the RNS Montgomery multiplication. In this architecture, a base extension algorithm is executed in parallel by plural Rower units controlled by a Cox unit. Each Rower unit is a single-precision modular multiplier-and-accumulator, whereas Cox unit is typically a 7 bit adder. Although the main body of the algorithm processes numbers in an RNS form, efficient procedures to transform RNS to or from a radix representation are also provided. The exponentiation algorithm can, thus, be adapted to an existing standard radix interface of RSA cryptosystem.},

All of them process in parallel and use an identical algorithm. Each partition executes its task in \mbi n/k steps. Even though the computation step operates in radix \mbi 2 k , the complexity is reduced by the use of a limited digit set. Experiments with a 90-nm cell library show that the hardware cost and its complexity have a linear growth according to the number of partitions. Besides the gain in speed, the proposal reduces power consumption for multiplication operands with 256, 512, 1024, and 2048 bits. The uniform treatment of partition hardware design enables the realization of a fault-tolerant hardware.},

abstract = {Montgomery modular multiplication is widely used in public-key cryptosystems. This work shows how to relax the data dependency in conventional word-based algorithms to maximize the possibility of reusing the current words of variables. With the greatly relaxed data dependency, we then proposed a novel scheduling scheme to alleviate the number of memory access in the developed scalable architecture. Analytical results show that the memory bandwidth requirement of the proposed scalable architecture is almost 1/(w - 1) times that of conventional scalable architectures, where w denotes word size. The proposed one also retains a latency of exactly one cycle between the operations of the same words in two consecutive iterations of the Montgomery modular multiplication algorithm when employing enough processing elements. Compared to the design in the related work, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed one achieves an almost 54 percent reduction in power consumption with no degradation in throughput. The reduced number of memory access not only leads to lower power consumption, but also facilitates the design of scalable architectures for any precision of operands.},
