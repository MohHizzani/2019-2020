\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{M}{any} new and old number systems has been introduced as a better alternative to IEEE-754 standards\cite{754} in the field of Deeplearning. An example of novel number systems is the Posit number system\cite{Gustafson2017}, which is known also as UNUM III. Posit was introduced as an advanced number system that overpass IEEE standards as a hardware-friendly system for general-purpose computation arithmetic operations that provides some faster versions of functions used in neural networks such as the Sigmoid function\footnote{Sigmoid function $\left(\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-1}}\right)$ is rarely used as an activation function. However, $\tanh$ function is widely used and it is a scaled and shifted version of the Sigmoid function $\left(\tanh(x) = 2 \sigma(2x) -1\right)$.}.
